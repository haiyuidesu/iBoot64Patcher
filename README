iBoot64Patcher

> Patch the iBoot64 with generic patches.

I. Requierements
	1. macOS/Linux,
	2. basic compilation tools,
	3. decrypted 64bit iBoot.

II. Usage
	$ iBoot64Patcher [--patch] <in> <out>
	   -p, --patch	apply the generics patches.

III. Notes
	> iBoot64Patcher supports any iBoots (PACed or not) from iOS 7 to iOS 15,
	> I used some technics of @dayt0n kairos project and @xerub xref64 function as well,
	> It can be turned into a full iBoot patcher, but kairos is a way better (mine can be used for tests purposes),
	> This 'project' was only made because of my dumb curiosity (if I could patch the iBoot64 using iBoot64Finder code).
