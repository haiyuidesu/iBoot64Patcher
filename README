III. Notes
	> kairos is a way better (mine can be used for tests purposes),
	> iBoot64Patcher supports any iBoots (PACed or not) from iOS 7 to iOS 15,
	> I used some technics of @dayt0n kairos project and @xerub xref64 function as well,
	> This 'project' was only made because of my dumb curiosity (if I could patch the iBoot64 using iBoot64Finder code).
